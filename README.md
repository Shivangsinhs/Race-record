# Race-record

Q) To get practice using logical operators and conditions, develop an algorithm for this artificial
situation:
We are building an app for athletes to record their best times for running the 100 metres and 400
metres. If they have broken the current world record, then the app will let them know!
For the 100 metres, the current Women’s world record is 10.49 seconds (set by Florence
Griffith-Joyner in 1988) and the current Men’s world record is 9.58 seconds (set by Usain Bolt in
2009).
For the 400 metres, the current Women’s world record is 47.60 seconds (set by Marita Koch in
1985) and the current Men’s world record is 43.04 seconds (set by Wayde van Niekirk in 2016).

Additionally, for the 100 metres, wind assistance can affect performance. A time is only eligible
for a world record if there is a tail wind of less than 2.0 metres per second.
Use the prompt() function to ask the user:
● Which event they are competing in (100m or 400m)
● if they are competing in the men’s or woman’s event
● their time
● if it is the 100m, the wind speed.
Then write a Boolean expression to evaluate the above conditions and generate a message using
the alert() function to tell them if they have broken the world record or not. Note that when
asking which event the user is competing in, acceptable answers should be “100m”, “400m”,
“men’s” or “women’s” and you should ignore case and punctuation. e.g. “Womans!” and “mEns”
would both be acceptable, as would “100M” and “400M”.
